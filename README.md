# ClassificationWorkshop

Most of the real world problems are solved through classification. We will give you a sneek-peek view of classfication through this workshop. We start with why is it more preferred in the industry. Then we dwell deep into a real world usecase of classification. We analyze, preprocess and build models. We also evaluate the models with different metrics. Below is the outline of topics covered

- Look at the data - Understand the data
- Pay attention to Y labels and distribution
- EDA
- Any quick features that you can think of
- Train test split
- Label encoding
- Model
- Investigate
- Explain
- Exercises

Workshop: [![Open Workshop In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/univai-ghf/ClassificationWorkshop/blob/main/Classification_main_&_homework.ipynb)

At the end of this workshop you will enhance your repertoire from understanding regression to being able to use a variety of models in classification problems. Additionally youâ€™ll understand which metrics to use to evaluate the performance of your models.
